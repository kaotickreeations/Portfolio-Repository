**Summary:**

* People aren't taking advantage of subscribing to our store program. Need to find a better way to optimize it's use

* Most of our customers are men. Women shop here half as much as men do. Perhaps we find a way to cater a bit more to women since they typically shop more than men do.Men also typically don't subscribe to retail store programs. Not as much as women do.

* May want to do some sort of sale around June-end of July as sales overall are the lowest here.

* A lot of our sales are from small purchases and not large ones. May want to do some type of discount promo where if you spend a certain amount, you get a certain dollar amount off your purchase.
